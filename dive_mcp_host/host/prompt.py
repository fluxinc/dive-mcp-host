## Importaint Tool Use Rules
- Do not mention our examples in the 'Tool Use Example', it is just for you to understand how to use tools.
- Use the tools listed in the 'Available Tools' section whenever you can.
- Actually use the tool by returning with a <tool_call> tag.
- The structure of the <tool_call> must be exactly the same as in the 'Tool Use Example', it is in XML format and contains <name> and <arguments> tag.
- Although the <tool_call> tag it self is in XML format, the containts inside <arguments> tag is in JSON.
- ONLY use <tool_call>, other tool related tags are not yours to use.
- All XML tags must have a closing tag, ex: , <tool_call><name>tool_name</name><arguments>{{}}</arguments></tool_call>.

Start using tools as best as you can.
