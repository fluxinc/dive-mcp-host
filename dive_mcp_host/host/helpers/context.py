class ContextProtocol(Protocol):
    """A context for a conversation.

    The ContextProtocol defines an interface for managing asynchronous context
    managers that provide conversation contexts. It ensures proper resource
    management and prevents reentrant usage.

    This protocol is used by classes that need to provide a context for
    conversations, such as database connections, model instances, or server
    connections.

    Example:
        class DatabaseContext(ContextProtocol):
            async def _in_context(self) -> AsyncGenerator[Self, None]:
                # Set up database connection
                try:
                    await self.connect()
                    yield self
                finally:
                    await self.disconnect()

        async with DatabaseContext() as db:
            # Use db here
            pass
